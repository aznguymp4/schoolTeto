# FAQ

## Where is the T-Spin detection?

Didn't bother to add it since it's a school project....... play **[Tetroblox](https://www.roblox.com/games/6795867689/)** instead!!!!11!1!11

## Score System? Combo Bonuses? Lock Delay? Music? Legitimate 0ARR? Top Out Detection?

Same reason as above ![](https://i.imgur.com/a69uWP7.png)

## Why is the DAS is little a bit buggy?

Making DAS actually work smoothly is actually harder than it seems. I was *going* to actually make it smooth like it should be, but I caught myself putting too much effort into a school project that I decided it's not worth it. __It's a school project, not a competitive e-sport platform.__ If you want a high-accuracy game, play **[Tetroblox](https://www.roblox.com/games/6795867689/)**, which is another game I made myself.

## Why do you suck at CSS?
